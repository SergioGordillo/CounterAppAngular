# What can you do with these three apps? :thinking:

:heart: The first one is a Counter App. <br>
:heart: The second one is an app when you can check information about heroes. <br>
:heart: The third one is an app where you can add to a list information about Dragon Ball Z characters. <br>

# Which technologies did I use to develop these apps? :thinking:

They are three little apps to practice Angular. I only use Angular (obviously with TS), to develop them. <br>

# Which is the purpose of these web app? :thinking:

They are three web apps I made based on Fernando Herrera Angular course üßê. I havent made barely changes compared to the project that Fernando Herrera made on the course, but just because I want to learn and adquire the basic Angular knowledge ü§ì. I know the styles are very basic, but I just focused on Angular stuff. I learnt with these projects about:

:heart: Angular folder structure.  <br>
:heart: One way and two way data binding. <br>
:heart: How to create components, modules, services etc.  <br>
:heart: About ngFor, ngIf, nfIfElse, ngTemplate, FormsModule, ngModel... <br>
:heart: Using @Input, @Outputs... <br>

They are three web apps in one projects, and they are simple apps too, that is the reason I havent deployed them.
